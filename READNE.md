# Image-Finder
`This a repository demonstrates a simple example of comparing images pixel by pixel.`

The code provides an implementation that allows you to analyze and compare individual pixels in two images to determine if they match or not.
By comparing the RGB values of each pixel, you can gain insights into the level of similarity between two images. 
This can be useful in various scenarios such as image similarity detection, image forgery detection, or identifying duplicated images.
